          <h3>Development Post Diamond And Pearl Games</h3>
          <body>
            <p>After the amazing launch of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl the directors were left with a deep hole to fill. The two games were made with the idea of making them the ultimate version of pokemon games, complete in every sense. 
            So how would the directors overcome this and make a game to rival the previous two? Well to start off with the directors didn't make an entire new game, no new region, no new starters, etc But rather they kept true to the diamond and pearl series and
            aimed to make more of an extension of these "Ultimate Pokemon Games" and decided to embark on a journey to make a Pokemon game to stand atop the Ultimate two. One of the first things to change with the making of this new game was the form of the poster pokemon themselves.
            In this new game the developers spent countless days working on a new look for the mysterious legendary Pokemon Giratina. In 2008 Giratina's new form was one of the first things released about Pokemon Platinum, leaving fans excited to what this new entry in the series would
            hold. With the addition of Giratina's new form the developers wanted to give Giratina its own domain, as well as something to appeal to players, more content if you will. They called this area the "Distortion World" (we'll talk more about this in the content section)
            Moving on to the naming of the game, the devlopers held great importance to the naming of their games. Pokemon Diamond and Pearl shared this intrest, the two games were named purposefully to represent their own unique meanings. For example Pokemon Diamond was named such as 
            according to the developers Diamond are related to feelings of love, for pearl the developers stated that they're associated with happiness. To follow up with their naming style the devlopers named their star game Pokemon Platinum with meaning. They detailed platinum as being different from
            diamond and pearl as it was not a gem, not made naturally but still shines brightly. They designed their new game to still be different despite taking place in relatively the same setting, they wanted to give off a different vibe to the players. They wanted the poster Pokemon Giratina to seem 
            cooler and more mysterious to players. They also made notable changes to the heart of game, including gym leaders and more! (we'll explore this topic in more detail in the content section) Some if the biggest changes the developers made to the core game is adding two new gameplay changing 
            monstrosities, the Wi-Fi Plaza and the battle frontier giving you both a way to communicate with other players and more exciting post game content!
