          <h3>Development Post Diamond And Pearl Games</h3>
          <body>
            <p>After the amazing launch of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl the directors were left with a deep hole to fill. The two games were made with the idea of making them the ultimate version of pokemon games, complete in every sense. 
            So how would the directors overcome this and make a game to rival the previous two? Well to start off with the directors didn't make an entire new game, no new region, no new starters, etc But rather they kept true to the diamond and pearl series and
            aimed to make more of an extension of these "Ultimate Pokemon Games" and decided to embark on a journey to make a Pokemon game to stand atop the Ultimate two. One of the first things to change with the making of this new game was the form of the poster pokemon themselves.
            In this new game the developers spent countless days working on a new look for the mysterious legendary Pokemon Giratina. In 2008 Giratina's new form was one of the first things released about Pokemon Platinum, leaving fans excited to what this new entry in the series would
            hold. With the addition of Giratina's new form the developers wanted to give Giratina its own domain, as well as something to appeal to players, more content if you will. They called this area the "Distortion World" (we'll talk more about this in the content section)
