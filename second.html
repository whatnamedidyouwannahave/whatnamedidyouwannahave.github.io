          <h3>Development Post Diamond And Pearl Games</h3>
          <body>
            <p>After the amazing launch of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl the directors were left with a deep hole to fill. The two games were made with the idea of making them the ultimate version of pokemon games, complete in every sense. 
            So how would the directors overcome this and make a game to rival the previous two? Well to start off with the directors didn't make an entire new game, no new region, no new starters, etc But rather they kept true to the diamond and pearl series and
            aimed to make more of an extension of these "Ultimate Pokemon Games" and decided to embark on a journey to make a Pokemon game to stand atop the Ultimate two.</p>
